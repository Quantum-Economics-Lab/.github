The Quantum Economics Lab researches value as an informational property constrained by entropy and verification cost. We develop theory, mathematical models, cryptographic primitives, and economic execution systems including EBIV and IntelliFi.

# Quantum Economics Lab

The Quantum Economics Lab is a research organization developing a scientific framework for value.

We study how value originates, propagates, and stabilizes across informational systems — bridging economics, cryptography, and computation.

### Mathematical Modeling
Simulations and stability analysis of trust and value networks.

### Cryptographic Systems
Entropy-bound intrinsic value, proof mechanisms, and verifiable cost.

### Economic Engineering
Implementation frameworks including IntelliFi and contribution-weighted economies.
